# Weather App (UI Shell)

A simple, static UI for a future weather application. Built with HTML + CSS (and ready for JavaScript). The goal is to practice clean layout, accessibility, and set up a foundation for fetching real weather data via an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

## Demo
A GitHub Pages link will be added in the future.

## Features
- Centered, responsive-ish layout with a header image
- Form to enter a location (city, country)
- Results section placeholders for city, temperature, and conditions
- Basic animation and card-style containers
- Accessible labels and semantic sections

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- *(JavaScript to be added in a next iteration)*
- *(Flask to be added in a next iteration)*
- *(SQLite to be added in a next iteration)*
